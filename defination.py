# what is request
# The requests module allows you to send HTTP
# requests using Python. The HTTP request returns
# a Response Object with all the response data (content, encoding, ...




# server
# Python has a built-in webserver provided by its standard 
# library, can be called for simple client-server communication. 
# The http.server and socketserver are the two main functions used to create 
# a web server. Port number can be defined manually 
# in the program which is used to access the webserver.


# client
# We use the generic term client to refer to
# a program that makes use of an implementation.
# We say that a Python program (a script or a module)
# that calls a function that is defined in a file
# named module.py is a client of module .



# webserver
# Web servers respond to Hypertext Transfer Protocol 
# (HTTP) requests from clients and send back a response 
# containing a status code and often content such as 
# HTML, XML or JSON as well.



# Full stack development: It refers to the development of both 
# front end(client side) and back end(server side)
# portions of web application.




# Full stack web Developers: Full stack web developers
# have the ability to design complete web applications 
# and websites. They work on the frontend, backend,
# database and debugging of web applications or websites.


# Front end: It is the visible part of website 
# or web application which is responsible for 
# user experience. The user directly interacts 
# with the front end portion of the web application or website.
# Front end Languages: The front end portion is
# built by using some languages which are discussed below:



# html
# HTML: HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
# It is used to design the front end portion of web
# pages using markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext
# and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages.
# The markup language is used to define the text documentation within tag 
# which defines the structure of web pages.


# css
# CSS: Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is
# a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of 
# making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to 
# web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the
# HTML that makes up each web page.



# javascript
# JavaScript: JavaScript is a famous scripting language used to create 
# the magic on the sites to make the site interactive for the user.
# It is used to enhancing the functionality of a website to running
# cool games and web-based software.


# Popular Stacks:

#     MEAN Stack: MongoDB, Express, AngularJS and Node.js.
#     MERN Stack: MongoDB, Express, ReactJS and Node.js
#     Django Stack: Django, python and MySQL as Database.
#     Rails or Ruby on Rails: Uses Ruby, PHP and MySQL.
#     LAMP Stack: Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP.



# server
# server are the important piece of full stack development.
# server is a bassically piece of software.which attentent some of the request of the user


# for example
# if you want a file so what will you do then you raise a request some of the software which can attentent to a request and print document as for your demand.
    # you can call a piece of a software print server it acculaaully attenting you and it serving you.
    # server is do something about is request
    
    # types of server
        # web server
# all about deling with http certain or certain can be handed  over the http protocol  
# it speak http
# http  server it can contain like imagefile video file html file using with http protocol
        # application server
# process of logic of calculating something and producing to the output to the user




        # authentication server
# allowing or not allowing to the resourse the user
        # email server
# deling with image 
        # data base server
# store the user data and produce data on demand.
        # file server
# storing and procucing on demand of the server.        




# api
# API is a shortcut for "Application Programming Interface".
# Loosely defined, API describes everything an application 
# programmer needs to know about piece of code to know
# how to use it.
